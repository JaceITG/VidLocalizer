# Discord Video Localizer

Discord Video Localizer is a Discord Bot script designed to solve the issue of videos which are sent in servers as links to Discord CDN content disappearing after the original content or server location is lost.

## Installation

I have been running with Python 3.7.9, not sure if newer builds will be difficult bc of Discordpy breaking changes

Install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Fill in the values in config.ini with the necessary IDs and Token to run the bot.

Create a folder called `downloads` in the program's main directory
